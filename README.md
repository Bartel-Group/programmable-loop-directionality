# programmable-loop-directionality

This repository exists to share the data and scripts used in the paper "Catalytic Resonance Theory: Forecasting the Flow of Programmable Catalytic Loops" by Madeline Murphy, Kyle Noordhoek, Sallye Gathmann, Paul Dauenhauer, and Christopher Bartel.

*NOTE*: The Github version of this repository does *not* contain the grid search results of the RF models due to the large file size. The grid search results of the RF models can be found through UMN's DRUM repository (found here - <https://doi.org/10.13020/bh14-3q71>) which acts as the permanent archive of our repository at the time of publication.

Description
-------------------

Three primary folders exist to separate the files used in generating the paper:

    Figures: Includes any (individual) plots which appear in the paper

    Machine-learning: includes the data and scripts used to generate and analyze the machine learning models

    Microkinetic-modeling: includes the data and scripts used to set-up/run the microkinetic models and generate the microkinetic model results (pre-machine learning analysis)

Each folder contains a README.md file that provides additional information related to the data and scripts contained within.
