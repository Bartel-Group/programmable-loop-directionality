# programmable-loop-directionality

Github repository including the data, figures, and scripts used in Murphy et. al Catalytic Resonance Theory: Forecasting the Flow of Programmable Catalytic Loops

Three folders exist to separate the files used in generating the paper:

    data: includes .csv and .pkl files of the simulation data (outputs), input parameter files, grid searches, and best estimators
    
    figures: includes .png files of all figures displayed in the manuscript (and some additional figures for the RC models)
    
    scripts: includes the necessary scripts and notebooks used to run the loop simulation, train ML models, and generate figure results or values reported in the paper
